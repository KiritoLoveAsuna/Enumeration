# I Got Urls
WaybackURLS + OtxURLS + CommonCrawl = The Best Results

## Usage
`python3 igoturls.py yourdomain.com`

## How it works?
- Getting Urls from archive.org
- Getting Urls from OTX AlienVault
- Getting Urls from last three index of CommonCrawl
- Doing all of that in the same time using threads.
- Erasing the parameters.
- Removing Duplicates.
